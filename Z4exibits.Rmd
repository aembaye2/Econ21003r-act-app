## 

The following equation which is the most important equation in growth economics as in many other fields like investment theory or business in general:  $$P_n= P_0(1 + g)^n$$ 
where:

$P_0$: The initial value of the variable at date 0 (e.g., today)

$P_n$: the value of the variable at future date $n$ years from now

$g$: the annual growth rate of the variable in decimal (you use 0.02 instead of 2 for 2\% growth rate)

$n$: the number of years between year  $0$ and $n$.

We can derive some important results from the above equation using some simple algebra:
$$g =\left( \frac{P_n}{P_0} \right)^{n}-1 \approx \frac{log(P_n/P_0)}{n}$$
$$n= \frac{log(P_n/P_0)}{log(1+g)}$$
$$P_0= \frac{P_N}{(1 + g)^n}$$ 


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
