      question:
        "Draw and label a graph that depicts a downward-sloping demand curve and an upward-sloping supply curve in the market for cocoa, denoting them D1 and S1, respectively. Identify the equilibrium price and quantity for cocoa in your graphs as 'e1'. From the article: 'Farmers in the top cocoa-producing region of the world are reseeding their lands ... The result is higher prices for chocolate lovers and a steep drop in production [of cocoa] from Ivory Coast and Ghana ...' Refer to the graph you drew before. Now show in the same graph using appropriate shift of supply or demand to show how a reseeding of land used to produce cocoa has caused an increase in the price of cocoa",

      question:
        "From the article: 'John Ato Sackey… grew cocoa for more than 30 years…in… Ghana…But… Sackey pulled up his cocoa trees…[and] is currently planting oil palm seedlings. We’re hoping that palm-oil production will be more… profitable…It’s less susceptible to disease, and it requires less labor…’ Assume that other cocoa farmers in Ghana choose to grow less cocoa and more palm oil. Refer to the graph you drew to answer the previous question to describe the impact on the equilibrium price and quantity of palm oil. In the article John Ato Sackey states: …the market demand for palm oil is high, so we’re hoping to make a good profit from it.' Refer to the graph you drew to answer the previous two questions. An increase in demand will increase the price of palm oil. Would the increase in price cause an increase in the supply or the quantity supplied of palm oil? briefly explain your answer.",
